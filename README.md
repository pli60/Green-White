Description:
        This is a generator that generator a landscape with a tree, grass, clouds, and a meteor. The scene has one tree, so I decided to make it random as well as the hill its on. The randomness in this project includes a random sized grass hill and a random branched tree. The reactivity in this project is the meteor which follows viewer's mouse x-position and I choose it because it moves across the sky just like in real life.

Artist Statement:
        I'm simply trying to remake the core scenary with simplified shapes which the viewers can still correlate with the inspiring image. I believe I achieved the effect because I can recognize the scenary I generate.
